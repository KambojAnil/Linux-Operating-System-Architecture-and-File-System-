Whats is linux ? 

Linux Operating System: Linux is an open-source Operating System, inspired from UNIX. It offers a hierarchical file system, treating processes, devices, and network sockets as file-like objects. Multitasking and multiuser, Linux is a powerful alternative to costly UNIX systems. Remember, Linux isn’t UNIX—it’s its own remarkable creation! Linux borrows heavily from the well-established family of UNIX operating systems. 
Note: Linux was inspired by UNIX, but it is not UNIX.
